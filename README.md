# Tsunami Response To Subduction Zones

Tsunamis modelled using three RSQSim earthquake catalogues that model the Hikurangi Subduction Margin and the Tonga-Kermadec Subduction Zone using alternative interpretations of the locking distribution.

The documents in this repository were used to undertake the research presented in the paper: "Effects of Subduction Interface Locking Distributions on Tsunami Hazard: a case study on the Hikurangi/Tonga-Kermadec Subduction Zones" Included is:

Earthquake_Catalogues - this contains information about the earthquakes in each of the catalogues.
Earthquake_Deformation - this contains all the earthquake deformation models that have been used.
Tsunami_at_the_coast - this contains that wave heights at the coast for all the modelled events
Tsuanmi_full_wave_field - this contains the entire tsunami wave field for a selection of events
figures - this contains the script used to generate all the figures in the paper.
